Py City School, assignment analysis
Below information shows us that Charter schools outperformed the District schools in overall passing rates.  Bailey high school has the highest number of students passing score in math (3318) and reading (4077) as well as both math and reading (2719). Although Bailey High School is a large school, has the highest total budget and has the most number of students that are passing it doesnt have the highest passing rate.  Cabrera High School, a medium size school has the highest passing rates. we can also see that spending per student and the size of school doesnt seem to have an impact on how successful a student is.  The scores are similar regardless of the spending. With this dataset we could also anaylze the success rates between male or female.
